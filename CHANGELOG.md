## Version 9

- Might tame the cat precision mongers by only listening for location updates 3 meters apart. Terrible, terrible.

## Version 6

- Maybe make app not nuke database on restart.
- Add settings page for setting settings.
- Make android device names not change on the reg because of firmware updates.
